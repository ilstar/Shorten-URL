Shorten-URL
===========

An Alfred workflow, it can help you to short your URL very quickly.

This is a fork of https://github.com/hzlzh/AlfredWorkflow.com/tree/master/Sources/Workflows/Shorten-URL, the different is if you already copy a url in your clipboard, you can get the result without paste the url into Alfred box, it good for lazy guy :smile:

### How it works

1. Copy a url, for instance `google.com`
2. Just type `short` in Alfred box(Don't need past url into the box, that's the difference with original one) ![Don't need past URL into the box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilstar/Shorten-URL/master/short.png)
3. Done!

Of course, you can type/paste the url into the box if you like, it's compatibility with original one.
